# This is the Official Git Repository for ITSC: Let's Build It Self Driving Cars

You can find all of the resources for the course in their respective folder


***ITSC: Let's Build It Self Driving Cars*** is a less traditional course under development by the **University of North Carolina at Charlotte**. The goal is to give students tangible milestones to work towards throughout the semester, that all build up to their final project. 

By the end of the semester, students will have built a self-driving vehicle that adheres to road rules with an AgileX LIMO robot. Through the course of the semester, students will work together to solve challenges in computer vision, robotics, machine learning and simulation. They will even teach each other some of the difficult concepts and be rewarded with real-world results. 

The goal of this course is to step away from the traditional lecture style classes, and move into a more malleable system that includes youtube videos, github pages, online threads and any other helpful resources that help students learn naturally. 



# Course Outline:

## Project 1:
- Get a robot to move in a straight line and stop at a certain distance
- ### Week 1-2 (Lab 0):
- This task is crucial for the development of **project 1** because before running a robot in the real world, it is very important to make sure everything is safe and working properly through a simulated environment such as `Gazebo Harmonic`. `Gazebo Harmonic` requires a Linux machine to download, and that is another good reason to use Docker Containers. 
- Docker Containers will also make sure that every student, regardless of their operating system, will be on the same page and will be able to follow along with the course without any major complications. 
- The significance of the ROS2 (Robot Operating System) demo is to introduce the students to some basic concepts of ROS2 (which is necessary for the development of robots). This is an essential step in understanding more difficult concepts such as how robots communicate with themselves. 
- ### Week 3 (Gazebo Assignment):
- The Gazebo assignment walks students through building robots in Gazebo. Not every student will be able to use their own robot during the course so this will be a good option for testing. When students have demonstrated that their code works and is safe, they will have the opportunity to test it with a real LIMO robot. 
- ### Week 4 (Sensors):
- The Week four lesson will teach students about the significance of sensors and data acquisition. Not only will this lead them into the next project where you combine AI models to change the behavior of the robot, but it will also be necessary so that the robot can detect when to stop in **project 1**


## Project 2:
- Get a robot to move in a stright line and stop at a certain distance ***while avoiding obstacles***
- ### Week 5 (Intro To AI):
- AI will be crucial for object detected and classification if we would like the robot to be able to stop when it comes close to them. AI can also be used to re-route the path when there is an obstruction in the way as well.
- ### Week 6 (Navigation):
- Navigation will build onto the path planning laid out by Artificial Intelligence. This is essential to get right if you would like to be able to achieve a variable drive path.
- ### Week 7 (Mapping):
- Mapping will be very important for being able to detect the distance to an object. Though AI can see and classify an object, being able to make different decisions based on how close those objects are will be a result of mapping.
## Project 3:
- Get the robot to move around corners autonomously and adhere to stop signs.
- ### Week 8 (Midtwerm):
- The midterm will be important to reinforce the skills and knowledge collected so far throughout the course. Every week builds upon the last, so it is crucial not to fall too far behind in terms of understanding and content. The midterm will help mitigate any abscence of knowledge. 
- ### Week 9 (AdvancedAI):
- Advanced AI will be used to make decisions based on sensor feedback to be able to imrpove safety and functionality. Combining every sensor component and using Machine Learning to come up with a decision maker is crucial for the development of self-driving vehicles. 
- ### Week 10 (Integrating AI / Robotics):
- In this week we will have create tangible outcomes given the results of these machine learning processes. This is very important to continue development and recieve results of the work that students have been putting in.
- ### Week 11 (Advanced Topics):
-

## Project 4:
- ### Week 12 (Collaborative Project):
- The collaborative project will be .....
- ### Week 13 (Fine Tuning):
- Self-driving vehicles require a very high level of safety and accuracy to be viable to put on the roads. Though students may have a working product at this stage, fine tuning is necessary to imrpove the safety and usability of the product that they are building.
- ### Week 14 (Final Preparation):
- 
- ###
