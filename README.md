***ITSC: Let's Build It Self Driving Cars*** is a less traditional course under development by the **University of North Carolina at Charlotte**. The goal is to give students tangible milestones to work towards throughout the semester, that all build up to their final project. 

By the end of the semester, students will have built a self-driving vehicle that adheres to road rules with an AgileX LIMO robot. Through the course of the semester, students will work together to solve challenges in computer vision, robotics, machine learning and simulation. They will even teach each other some of the difficult concepts and be rewarded with real-world results. 

The goal of this course is to step away from the traditional lecture style classes, and move into a more malleable system that includes youtube videos, github pages, online threads and any other helpful resources that help students learn naturally.
