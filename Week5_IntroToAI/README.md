# Introduction to AI for Robotics

**Artificial Intelligence** is the field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and understanding languages such as English or Spanish. AI enables machines to adapt to new inputs, make decisions, and improve their performance over time through experience and data.

AI is extremely versatile and one of the areas that it has heavily affected is robotics. AI is everywhere you look in robotics. Industrial robots, service robots, medical robots and educational robots all rely heavily on artificial intelligence. Robotics uses AI in ways such as for perception, decision-making, and learning/adaptation. 

In this section of the course, you will learn about some of these AI models and how to implement them in robotics. 


# Implementation
- There are many tools out there that have been created to make implementing code really easy. This is also known as inference (running a working model from the internet with your own data). for our first lesson, you will use the camera on your computer to create and object detection model using a pre-made model called [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) that was created by a company called Utralytics.
