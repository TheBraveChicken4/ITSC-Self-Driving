# Sensors and Data Acquisition

Imagine being placed in the middle of a an unknown desert. You're left without sight from your eyes, sound from the environment, and touch to feel the ground. You want to leave the desert but you have absolutely no idea where to even begin. 

This is a similar scenario for a robot that doesn't have sensors. Robots use a host of different sensors such as **cameras**, **Lidar**, **IMUs** ***(Inertial Measurement Units)*** **radar** and more. Though a robot can operate with only one of these sensors, combining many or all of them can lead to some powerful applications. Sensors are crucial for more complex aplications like self-driving. Imagine a Tesla trying to find its way through a city without cameras.
